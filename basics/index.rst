Tricks
======

Tricks
------

.. container:: item-incremental

    - Someone `leads` the trick (choosing freely from hand cards)

    - In clockwise order, everyone plays a card to the trick

      - Everyone must follow suit lead, if possible

      - You do not have to play higher than other cards

      - Otherwise, you `discard` any other suit card

    - The winner is the highest card in the lead suit

      - 8\ |c| |rarr| 2\ |c| |rarr| 9\ |d| |rarr| 4\ |c| = 8\ |c| wins

      - The winning player collects trick and leads next trick

    - The entire hand is played over 13 tricks

.. warning:: STOP AND PLAY A HAND

    Stop and play a hand like this. Pick a random person to be first lead.

Trump Hands
-----------

.. container:: item-incremental

    - Some hands are like that --- these are `no trump` hands

    - A `trump` hand has a "boss suit"

      - The *contract* determines if there is a trump suit, and which one

    - Any card of any suit can be lead

    - Players must follow suit lead, if possible

    - The winner is the highest trump card played

      - If no trump cards played, winner is highest of suit led

      - If |d| is trump: 8\ |c| |rarr| 2\ |c| |rarr| 2\ |d| |rarr| 4\ |c| = 2\ |c| wins


.. warning:: STOP AND PLAY A HAND

    Stop and play a hand with a randomly-chosen trump suit and a random leader

Game Basics
===========

Partnership
-----------

- Bridge is a partnership game

  - N and S are partners, as are E and W

  - Both partners win a trick, and their score is the same

Contract
--------

.. container:: item-incremental

    - Every hand has a *contract* set by one team:

      - A promise by team to win certain number of tricks

      - Contract specifies trump suit or no trump

    - The side with the contract is `declaring` team, other is `defending` team

Starting a Hand
---------------

.. container:: compare compare32

    .. container::

        Declaring team has two people:

        - One who decided the contract: `declarer`

        - Other is `dummy` *(silent, not dumb!)*

        .. container:: item-incremental

            1. Defender left of declarer makes lead

            2. Dummy's hand is put face up for everyone

            3. Declarer plays their hand *and* dummy's

            4. Defenders play their own hands

    .. container:: one-incremental

      *After lead, dummy is put down*

      *Declarer is south here* |BR|
      *Only declarer sees their hand*

Role of Dummy
-------------

.. container:: item-incremental

    - Everyone at table can see 50% of cards!

      - Declarer sees their team cards

      - Defenders see their own cards plus dummy

    - The dummy player doesn't talk or help out

.. warning:: STOP AND PLAY

    Deal and all players describe their hands. The team with stronger-looking
    hands should declare (just a trump suit or no trump). The stronger member
    of the team should be the declarer.
