Second Hand Low
---------------

- When playing 2nd on hand, generally play low

- Your partner may be able to win with the 4th card

- If it's the `setting` trick, take it!

Third Hand High
---------------

- When playing 3rd, try to capture trick

- Only go as high as you need to

Cover Honor With An Honor
-------------------------

- If honor card played before you, cover it

- That often forces other team to spend a higher honor
