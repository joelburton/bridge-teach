Auction Ideas
=============

Auction Ideas
-------------

- Figure out *strain* *("Where")* and *level* *("How High")*

- Get to game *(big bonus!)* or stop as low as possible

Balanced vs Unbalanced Hands
----------------------------

- Balanced hands: 4333 4432 or 5332

  - No voids/singletons, no more than 1 doubleton

- May want to play these hands in NT

Limited vs Unlimited Bids
-------------------------

- |Limited| bids: have a narrow definition

- |Unlimited| bids: have a wider-ranging definition

Forcing, Invitational, Signoff Bids
-----------------------------------

- |Force| bids: partner absolutely should big again

- |Invite| bids: partner is invited to bid again if worthy

- |Signoff| bids: partner should not bid any further

Captaincy
---------

The "captain" is the player who knows more about the team's values.

They are the one who should decide how to land the contract.

.. newslide::

Example auction:

.. container:: item-incremental

  1. *West:* |Invite| with 1\ |s| *(13+ pts, 5+*\ |s|\ *)* |bu|

     - East has very incomplete picture of West's hand so far

  2. *East:* |Invite| with 1NT *(6-10 pts, no 4 card Major)* |bl|

     - West now understands where East is and becomes *captain*

     - West knows best: might pass, raise NT, show another suit, etc.

.. newslide::

Captaincy can change during auction:

.. container:: item-incremental

  1. *West:* |Invite| with **1NT** *(15-17 HCP, balanced hand)* |bl|

     - East has very clear picture of West's hand

     - East becomes the *captain*; the one who steers the auction next

  2. *East:* |Invite| **2NT** *(8-9 HCP, balanced hand)* |bi| |bl|

     - West now has very clear picture of East's hand

     - East is asking West to decide if 3NT is feasible

     - West becomes the "captain"

  3. *West:* |Signoff| **3NT** *(had 17HCP; 17+8=25, enough for 3NT)*


5 Card Major System
-------------------

The most common straightforward system, based on *natural* bids

Most bids are truthful about what is being suggested and feel natural


.. newslide:: +Principles:

.. container:: item-incremental

  - Play in Major suit if fit found and aim for game

  - Play in NT if balanced and aim for game

  - Play in minor suit only if needed *(hard to reach game in minors)*

  - 5-3 splits more common than 4-4; system designed to find 5-3 Majors

    - Opening bids of 1\ |s| and 1\ |h| require 5 in suit

Opening
=======

Opening
-------

- Become opener with 12+ HCP (or 13+ points)

  - Partner of `opener` becomes the `responder`

- If no one opens *(everyone passes)*, redeal hand

Opening Balanced
================

Opening Balanced
----------------

========== ======== ========================== ========
Range      HCP      1st Bid                    2nd Bid
========== ======== ========================== ========
Minimum    12-14    |Invite| with 5+ *Major*
                    or better *minor* |bu|     1NT |bl|
Medium     15-17    |Invite| with 1NT |bl|
Maximum    18-19    |Invite| with 5+ *Major*
                    or better *minor* |bu|     2NT |bl|
Extras     20-22    |Invite| with 2NT |bl|
========== ======== ========================== ========

.. container:: item-incremental

    - Medium or Extras are |Limited|

      - Described so well, responder becomes captain

    - Min and Max are |Unlimited|

      - Can't tell these will be NT hands yet

      - If make 2nd bid, |Limited|, responder becomes captain

Opening Unbalanced
==================

Opening Unbalanced
------------------

.. container:: item-incremental

    - Likely to be played in trump

    - Add *distribution points*

      - +1 for each card in suit after fourth

      - eg, |s| **A K Q J 3 2** |h| **7 6 5 4 3** |c| 8 7 |rarr| 10 + (2) + (1) = 13

5+ Card Major
-------------

.. container:: item-incremental

    - Open 1 of Major suit

      - Open longer; if equal: |s| over |h|

    - |Invite|, |Unlimited|: 13-21 points

      - Might be a min/max balanced bid in "disguise"

Nothing Else To Do
------------------

.. container:: item-incremental

    - Open better minor suit at 1 level

      - Not promising you like suit --- could have only 3

    - |Invite|, |Unlimited|: 13-21 points

      - Might be a min/max balanced bid in "disguise"
